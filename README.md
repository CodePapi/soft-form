*A pure React form with some real-life validation scenarios*

[Documentation](./DOCUMENTATION.md) | [Demo](https://soft-form.netlify.app)

## How to run

You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and npm installed to be able to run this application.

Install the packages required to run the app with `npm install` if you use `npm`, or `yarn install` if you use `yarn`

**Development Mode** `npm run dev`

Running the app in the development mode does not minify the Tailwind CSS build file.
Once build is complete and app is running, visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) on your web browser

**Build** `npm run build`

Building the app generates a minified version of the app in the `build` folder. The generated `build` folder can be deployed as a static website

**Start locally** `npm run start:local`

Starting locally builds a minified version of the app and opens it in a web browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
